Your component description.

<cells-step-loan-offer></cells-step-loan-offer>
```

## Icons

Since this component uses icons, it will need an [iconset](https://bbva.cellsjs.com/guides/best-practices/cells-icons.html) in your project as an [application level dependency](https://bbva.cellsjs.com/guides/advanced-guides/application-level-dependencies.html). In fact, this component uses an iconset in its demo.
